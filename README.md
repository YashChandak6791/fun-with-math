# fun-with-math
As a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, I often find myself watching YouTube videos about fascinating topics in math (love Numberphile and 3Blue1Brown) and try to code my own version of the mathematical topic. Usually the code doesn't lead to anything tangible, but it's fun thinking about the two fields together :)
